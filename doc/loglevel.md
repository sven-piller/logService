FATAL – The application is in a critical state and cannot proceed with the execution of the current operation. In this case, the application usually reports such message and terminates.
ERROR – A serious problem occurred while processing the current operation. Such a message usually requires the user to interact with the application or research the problem in order to find the reason and resolve it.
(Tip: Exceptions are usually reported as errors because they usually have a similar meaning.)
WARNING – Such messages are reported when something unusual happened that is not critical to process the current operation (and the application in general), but it would be useful to review this situation to decide if it should be resolved. (Tip: This level is usually selected as active for applications in production.)
INFO – Informative messages are usually used for reporting significant application progress and stages. Informative messages should not be reported too frequently because they can quickly become “noise.”
DEBUG – Used for debugging messages with extended information about application processing. Such messages usually report calls of important functions along with results they return and values of specific variables, or parameters.
TRACE – This level is most informative (and usually even excessive). Trace messages report most of application actions or events and are mostly used to follow application logic in full detail.
